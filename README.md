The scripts in this repository are mainly intended for the analysis of neuronal dynamics in intracellular recordings. These codes have been developed during the process of the thesis in Computer Engineering and Telecommunications, in the Computational Neuroscience and Natural Computing program. 
  
  `charact_utils.py` contains a library used in the rest of the codes. 
  
  `lasers/superpos_functions.py` contains a library mainly used for action potential waveform analysis.
  
  `invariants/invariants_functions.py` contains a library for the analysis of time intervals and their variability. 

A detailed documentation and a cleaner version of the codes is coming soon.
